// Package ipfscluster implements a wrapper for the IPFS deamon which
// allows to orchestrate pinning operations among several IPFS nodes.
//
// IPFS Cluster uses a go-libp2p-raft to keep a shared state between
// the different cluster peers. It also uses LibP2P to enable
// communication between its different components, which perform different
// tasks like managing the underlying IPFS daemons, or providing APIs for
// external control.
