# IPFS cluster use cases 

These are some WIP ipfs-cluster use case sketches.  These are not formal use cases and are more accurately groups of related use cases; they could be further decomposed into the more narrowly scoped operations found in formal use cases.

## ipfs node mirror
Actors:
	ipfs user

Description: An ipfs user with multiple machines wants to run their ipfs node with better replication or availability guarantees.  The user creates an ipfs cluster across machines.  Adding content to ipfs automatically triggers a pin in the cluster according to some predetermined replication strategy.  The user advertises multiaddresses from all the ipfs daemons as multiaddresses of the ipfs node mirror.

Thoughts: This use case, like others, requires some mechanism for automatic pinning upon adding to ipfs.  Depending on the adding mechanism this might be straightforward functionality to add to cluster, for example cluster's ipfs proxy add endpoint will probably eventually do this by default.  However in some cases, such as if each machine writes to ipfs over the fuse interface, this would be more difficult.  A mirrored node could potentially advertise itself as an ipfs node and advertise the cluster ipfs proxy endpoint addresses as its multiaddresses.

## Storing blockchain data

Note this is a bit broader than other sketches.  It could eventually split into multiple use cases.  They all amount to a specific case of storing blockchain data on ipfs and storing so much that it is impractical for a single node to store it all.

Description: A party or collection of trusted parties interested in storing a blockchain create an ipfs cluster for their particular storage needs.

1. As one example consider a mining operation that needs access to a transaction given its hash to properly validate transactions.  Furthermore imagine the set of transactions is too large to fit on any of the mining organization's machines.  The mining organization uses an ipfs cluster to pin all of the blockchain's transactions once they are accepted into the network's history with a sufficient guarantee (e.g. wait 10 blocks before pinning).  Later on when transactions are needed for validation they are guaranteed to be available over ipfs on some of the cluster's nodes.  If fault tolerance is important the blockchain could be stored with replication that improves the odds of recovery in the face of machine failures.

2. As another example consider a website operating as a [blockchain explorer](https://blockexplorer.com/).  Such sites act as an interface to a blockchain network's history.  This site could maintain the database of history using an ipfs cluster.  When a new hash is requested for view, the site's servers would check the backing cluster and go to the blockchain's network for the data if it is not pinned.  Additionally the blockchain explorer's node in the network would continually listen for new data, check if the hash exists in the cluster, and add and pin otherwise.

3. As a last example imagine a cluster serving as storage backing searching for potentially large queries over blockchains.  For example say you want to look for all transactions that spend from the output transactions from block X.  You could potentially use ipld selectors to query and pin all of the relevant hashes in an ipfs node, but what if there is too much data to reasonably fit on any one ipfs node's machine?  A group of trusted nodes could be brought together to handle such queries as an ipfs-cluster and avoid running out of space for storing the results.

Thoughts:
1. To seriously support storing data for miners we would probably need to examine ipfs-cluster's latency profile more seriously. The above description does not specify how to prevent the set of pinned cids from ballooning quickly.  This use case would require some kind of sharding of the transaction set in a way that does not track every transactions pin in the cluster shared state.  Because new transactions would be added all the time this is not a simple application of basic sharding, which does one import of a huge file into shards.  ipfs-cluster could address this with a strategy for incrementally updating shard membership.  The state blow-up could also be mitigated if the cluster recursively (to a certain depth) pinned larger subdags dags, i.e. the hash of every X blocks.  The security of go-ipfs would need to be vetted more thoroughly so that users could trust that hash lookups securely resolve to the correct data.  In general this use case idea needs more domain specific knowledge.  Is blockchain storage currently a pain point for mining operations that ipfs and cluster could address?  How do popular mining clients (bitcoin-core, geth) handle blockchain storage?  Would ipfs integration using ipfs-cluster for storing large merkle dags be possible/useful/welcome for these clients? What are their requirements (latency, security models, integration with existing tools)?

2. For the second example you could imagine that the block explorer is a dApp with users running ipfs and caching blockchain data as they look it up and the ipfs-cluster acts as a permanent store for slower lookups (similar pattern to use case below).  If this becomes a serious use case we should investigate pain points that currently exist for block explorer websites to get a better picture of how cluster would fit in.

3. This is a very undeveloped idea (ipld selectors don't exist yet, I haven't seen anyone ask for this) based on my impression that quick, expressive merkle dag searches would be valuable.  I should investigate work that exists along these lines (ex, how do current block explorer's do queries over merkle trees?), and how ipld selectors compare as a next step.

## ipfs CDN for dApp data

Actors:
	users of a dApp
	"superusers" of a dApp

Description: Many distributed applications work on the premise that the users of the application can provide sufficient resources (storage & bandwidth) for the application to run smoothly.  However it is not hard to imagine a group invested in the success of the dApp, for example the original creators or a non-profit entity, with resources and motivation to help it succeed contributing large amounts of resources to benefit the dApp.  Let's call these entities "superusers".  For example in the above discussion of a distributed blockchain explorer it is likely that most users will be looking at recent transactions in the network's history.  Superusers of the dApp could improve performance of the explorer on older less frequently queried transactions by caching the entire history somewhere.  ipfs-cluster could fit into the picture as a storage and distribution facility used by superusers of a dApp to provide supplemental resources to the users of a network.  Superusers set up a cluster to pin certain data for the good of the ecosystem and then the underlying ipfs nodes handle the distribution.  Superusers would rely on ipfs-cluster providing dynamic allocation for load-balancing, support for complex allocation policies taking into account network topology, and potentially security policies allowing for access control.  For a specific use case that conforms fairly well to the dApp CDN model see "Home directories with ipfs-cluster" below.

## Backend for ipfs gateways

## Long-distance bidirectional offsite backups (first reported here https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/157)

Actors:
	admin of a local network

Description: An admin wants automatic backups of a local network's data to an offsite location.  The offsite storage is also located in its own local network in need of its own backup storage.  The admin therefore needs some mechanism for bidirectional backups.  NAS units in the two networks serve as local backup devices.  The admin runs ipfs on the NAS units in each network, exposing their fuse interfaces to allow for conventional means of local backups within the local network, for example using rsync between the NAS and machines in need of backup.  Additionally end user machines are granted access to the local network's ipfs endpoint, again via the fuse interface, to allow backup mechanisms like Time Machine to the NAS.  The admin sets up the system so that the NAS units in each network host both an ipfs and cluster daemon.  When data is backed up in a NAS's ipfs daemon, it is automatically pinned by cluster and replicated as appropriate to the offsite backups.  The admin can add new NAS units in the existing or in new networks to the ipfs-cluster without difficulty.

Implied ipfs-cluster requirements:
- Some way to automatically cluster pin (with a standard replication policy) anything that is added to the ipfs peer
- Any cluster peer can add and replicate content (true today)
- Adding new peers to an ipfs-cluster is a smooth process (mostly true today)
- ipfs-cluster can handle the latencies of long distance backups (I think mostly true especially with new raft config options, but this should be measured)

Thoughts: Perhaps cluster should support a way to allow for automatically pinning anything added to the ipfs daemon.  If things are added by the api endpoint this could be achievable by substituting the ipfs api endpoint with the cluster endpoint and performing a cluster pin before proxying the add to the ipfs daemon.  However if things are added to the fuse interface this won't work, so maybe the general solution is outside of cluster's scope. 


## Pinning Rings (first reported here https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/7)

Actors:
	users in an existing pinning ring
	users interested in joining / leaving the pinning ring
	a ring administrator (potentially multiple, potentially 0)

Description: A collection of users interested in collaboratively storing a collection of data together make up an ipfs-cluster pinning ring by storing data on ipfs and adding each other as cluster peers.  When existing users want to add content, they simply add it to their ipfs nodes and pin with an appropriate replication strategy depending on the pinning ring's setup and the content being pinned.  Pinning rings that are short on storage may choose not to replicate, pinning rings looking for robustness may use high replication factors or fault tolerance strategies (see PR #268).

The barrier for entry/exit is low, any user with an ipfs node and free space is welcome to join pinning rings.  When a new user wishes to enter, they provide a peer ID and multiaddr to either a ring administrator (or perhaps any participant) add the new peer to the cluster.  It is also possible that the pinning ring will allow the peer to add itself to the cluster.  The new peer then autodiscovers the rest of the ring's peers, joins the consensus and now this node provides storage to the cluster.  Similarly peers can leave the pinning ring without much warning.  Perhaps within cluster or perhaps out of band peers about to disconnect could signal this so that their pins are not totally dropped from the cluster.  Lots of storage and aggressive replication could be used to remove the fallout of sudden disconnections.

While peers within a pinning ring are allowed the priveleges of a cluster peer such as the power to add and remove peers, unpin content across the cluster, and change replication factors, any cluster peer can audit the operations taking place by looking at the log maintained by consensus.  In the event a peer consistently misbehaves pinning rings may potentially wish to take action by somehow restricting this peer's access.  On a somewhat similar note pinning rings may also wish to grant "observe only" access to the cluster.

Implied ipfs-cluster requirements:
- support for dynamic cluster membership (exists today but potentially some bugs with lots of churn)
- some kind of trust modeling support, potentially including associating permissions to operations and assigning permissions to peers.  Could make use of the proposed [capabilities service](https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/274).
- support for byzantine consensus protocols sounds relevant
- support for updating many uncoordinated nodes

Thoughts:
This is a particularly intersting use case as it requires more significantly new and unexplored functionality from cluster than any of the others here.  As @hsanjuan mentioned in his original write up "The key here is to understand what the trust model is in a pinning ring, how members gain and lose trust, and who can take what actions".  On a similar note a byzantine consensus protocol may greatly help keep the ring working smoothly even when some peers misbehave.  This use case also presents challenges regarding how to get nodes to update when they are managed by different individuals.  The current approach to updating requires all nodes to be shut down at the same tiem which may be unrealistic here.

This would be a "dynamic" cluster with lots of peer membership churn.  ipfs-cluster will need to thoroughly work out any issues with peer membership changes for this to work well.  Additionally peer set churn makes things like fault tolerant sharding with potentially expensive data recovery algorithms hard to support as recovery might be run frequently.  My guess is that pinning with high replication factors will be better for this use case.


## Big ipfs node for ubuntu archive seeding (reported here https://discuss.ipfs.io/t/ubuntu-archive-on-top-of-ipfs/1579)

Actors:
	admin of package-seeding cluster
	mirror site providing package data
	users fetching packages over ipfs

Description:  An admin wishes to set up an ipfs node storing a mirror of ubuntu deb packages to support an apt transport that downloads deb packages from ipfs.  The admin wishes to download the packages and directory structure from one of the existing mirrors over http and store in ipfs.  The admin does not have a server with the 2TB of storage necessary to host the entire mirror and so cannot fit all packages on a single ipfs node.  However the admin does have access to a set of smaller servers (say 4 servers of 50GB) that together fulfill the total storage capacity of the mirror.  The admin installs ipfs-cluster on each server and then commands the cluster to download the mirror data.  During download the cluster allocates different pieces of the mirror directory to different machines, spreading load evenly.  If there is extra space on the servers then replication of packages is a bonus, but this is not a primary concern for this usecase.  The cluster hosting the mirror can be assumed stable, with a fixed number of servers all ran by a single admin or administrative body.  After packages are added to the cluster users will fetch packages by path name from the root hash (QmAAA.../mirrorDir1/mirrorDir2/package.deb).  

Implied ipfs-cluster requirements
- ipfs-cluster can handle importing, sharding and distributing across the cluster a file too big for one node, see PR #268.
- ipfs importers can import ubuntu archives as directories

Thoughts:
This use case's requirement on sharding large files is blocked on implementing basic sharding in cluster.  It is a clear goal of cluster to eventually support this and other use cases ingesting large amounts of data into ipfs.  Although this is possible without ipfs support for an importer specific to the ubuntu archive data format, this use case would work best with such support.  This implies a need for a refactored and user extensible library (dagger/dex) for handling the data format --> ipld dag transformation across many data formats.


## Home directories with ipfs-cluster (first reported here https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/3)

Actors:
	file system users
	system admin

Description:  An admin wishing to host a distributed filesystem on ipfs-cluster sets up a few ipfs-cluster machines on dedicated nodes on a WAN.  Nodes in the same LAN or same region are organized in a sub cluster.  The admin begins by adding existing home directories to ipfs-cluster.  This includes adding unix style authentication information to different directories and files so that only those with the right permissions can access files.  After set up is complete, users begin accessing their files, reading, writing and sharing amongst themselves.  When users get started with the new file system they add a new ipfs-cluster peer located on their local machine or workstation to the cluster, this way they can contribute to storing and distributing user data while accessing files.  Throughout the life-time of the distributed file-system’s use the admin administers the underlying ipfs-cluster with a web-based management console.  Clients can provide quotas across a couple of metrics (ex: bandwidth and storage) so that ipfs-cluster doesn’t hog all their resources.

Implied ipfs-cluster requirements:

- ipfs-cluster provides key management, allow for per-user keys and implements built in encryption for robust, out-of-the-box security. 
- ipfs-cluster’s replication strategies are sophisticated enough to achieve excellent availability, this may include live, feedback-based replication strategies that take into consideration the popularity and age of files
- ipfs-cluster exposes a management console that allows the setting of authentication and encryption metadata, and setting policies for ipfs-cluster as a unit and the sub clusters of which it consists.  Policy parameters include replication schemes and allocation schemes based on storage space, location, bandwidth and subcluster membership.  
- ipfs-cluster implements complex allocation strategies and supports the policies that outline these strategies, as well as live updates of these policies
- ipfs-cluster provides configurable load balancing across ipfs-cluster nodes (WAN cluster and LAN subclusters have different balancers), that can handle frequent changes to peersets
- ipfs-clusters are easy to join and leave without having to think too much about set-up or generating errors
- ipfs-cluster allows for retrieval of data across sub clusters that are not necessarily connected, except as two subtrees of the same larger cluster.
ipfs-cluster allows individual peers to specify resource constraints 

Thoughts:
This is a mature use case that requires a lot of not-yet-there features.  It's something good to shoot for but more long term.  From a quick glance it seems likely that some of the sought-after features might belong to other projects (maybe the permissioning of the file-system and built in security primitives belong in a layer over ipfs for example, maybe some of the balancer and replication strategy modules could be pluggable and project specific).  Accessing data pinned in one subcluster from another subcluster is an interesting problem given the current composite cluster module that we should think about further.



# IPFS cluster historical context and motivation

This section is an attempt to help explain why ipfs-cluster exists, why people use it and why it looks the way it does.  A lot of this summarizes old discussion scattered around other repos, issues and docs, so please read the linked documents to get the full context.  This is kept with use cases for now because it helps frame ipfs-cluster in terms of the general set of problems it can solve and the general interface that it provides users.  This in turn facilitates imagining broader use cases for cluster that are non-obvious from today's implementation.  

## ipfs-cluster's Purpose: ipfs Coordination
ipfs-cluster is a tool to coordinate ipfs nodes together.  It was clearly described here during its early planning stages: https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/58.
From this description ipfs-cluster can be used to coordinate any aspect of an ipfs node’s state among a group of ipfs nodes.  This includes pin sets, the current focus of the project, but could also include state related to bitswap strategies or inter-node trust models, etc.  To achieve coordination of complex state among ipfs nodes without centralization, the ipfs-cluster project relies on a consensus protocol.  Today this is raft but in the future we want to make this pluggable.  Today the project is solely focused on coordinating pinset state: https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/blob/master/README.md.  This is a sensible place to focus because ipfs is at its core a protocol for storing and moving data and the pinset of an ipfs node determines what data it stores and distributes.


## A key concept: the ipfs vNode abstraction:
Early discussion, again in https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/58, outlines a particular approach that remains relevant to discussion today: ipfs-cluster as a virtual ipfs node (vNode for short).  The idea is that ipfs-cluster nodes could implement the ipfs api, only exposing state agreed upon by all nodes through consensus.  A simple example: all nodes in the cluster agree on a single peer id, and after reaching agreement all nodes respond with this id to requests on their ipfs vNode id endpoint.  A more useful example: an ipfs-cluster node gets an `add <file>` request through the ipfs vNode add endpoint, the cluster nodes coordinate adding this file, perhaps doing something clever like replicating file data across multiple nodes, and reach agreement that the data was added and pinned successfully via consensus.  After all this occurs the api endpoint returns the normal message indicating success.

Designing ipfs-cluster to work this way has some benefits, including a familiar api for user interaction, the ability to use a cluster anywhere an ipfs node is used and the ability to make ipfs-clusters depend on other ipfs-clusters as the ipfs nodes that they coordinate.  This last property has the potential to make scaling ipfs-cluster easier; if large groups of participants can be abstracted away consensus peer group size can remain bounded as cluster participants grow arbitrarily.  It is not always the case that an ipfs api is the best user interface for adding files to ipfs-cluster.  Ipfs-cluster's support for behavior like per-pin replication configuration information, for example the current feature that pins can specify different replication factors, has no direct analogue to characteristics of an ipfs node exposed over the ipfs api.  As the ipfs api has no endpoint to encode this information, some kind of cluster specific interface is often useful, for example the current cluster `pin` command that allows setting replication factors.

Though an ipfs vNode api IS partially implemented in ipfs-cluster to the point that ipfs-clusters can be composed, only the subset of the vNode api that ipfs-cluster needs to call in order to function has received attention.  There has been some discussion, in “Other open questions” https://github.com/hsanjuan/ipfsclusterspec/blob/master/README.md, about the difficulties involved in implementing a full ipfs vNode interface, and framing the vNode interface as a separate concern from the ipfs-cluster project’s primary goal of coordinating ipfs nodes.  Today emphasis on implementing the vNode interface exists to the extent that it enables composition of ipfs-clusters, and further work may be revisited.
