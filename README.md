> Collective pinning and composition for IPFS.

**THIS SOFTWARE IS ALPHA**

`ipfs-cluster` allows to replicate content (by pinning) in multiple IPFS nodes:

* Works on top of the IPFS daemon by running one cluster peer per IPFS node (`ipfs-cluster-service`)
* A `replication_factor` controls how many times a CID is pinned in the cluster
* Re-pins stuff in a different place when a peer goes down
* Provides an HTTP API and a command-line wrapper (`ipfs-cluster-ctl`)
* Provides an IPFS daemon API Proxy which intercepts any "pin"/"unpin" requests and does cluster pinning instead
* The IPFS Proxy allows to build cluster composition, with a cluster peer acting as an IPFS daemon for another higher-level cluster.
* Peers share the state using Raft-based consensus. Uses the LibP2P stack (`go-libp2p-raft`, `go-libp2p-rpc`...)

## Maintainers and Roadmap

This project is captained by [@hsanjuan](https://github.com/hsanjuan). See the [captain's log](CAPTAIN.LOG.md) for a written summary of current status and upcoming features. You can also check out the project's [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for a high level overview of what's coming and the project's [Waffle Board](https://waffle.io/ipfs/ipfs-cluster) to see what issues are being worked on at the moment.

## Install

### Pre-compiled binaries

You can download pre-compiled binaries for your platform from the [dist.ipfs.io](https://dist.ipfs.io) website:

* [Builds for `ipfs-cluster-service`](https://dist.ipfs.io/#ipfs-cluster-service)
* [Builds for `ipfs-cluster-ctl`](https://dist.ipfs.io/#ipfs-cluster-ctl)

Note that since IPFS Cluster is evolving fast, the these builds may not contain the latest features/bugfixes as they are updated only bi-weekly.

### Docker

You can build or download an automated build of the ipfs-cluster docker container. This container runs both the IPFS daemon and `ipfs-cluster-service` and includes `ipfs-cluster-ctl`. To launch the latest published version on Docker run:

`$ docker run ipfs/ipfs-cluster`

To build the container manually you can:

`$ docker build . -t ipfs-cluster`

You can mount your local ipfs-cluster configuration and data folder by passing `-v /data/ipfs-cluster your-local-ipfs-cluster-folder` to Docker.

### Install from sources

Installing from `master` is the best way to have the latest features and bugfixes. In order to install the `ipfs-cluster-service` the `ipfs-cluster-ctl` tools you will need `Go` installed in your system and the run the following commands:

```
$ go get -u -d github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster
$ make install
```

This will install `ipfs-cluster-service` and `ipfs-cluster-ctl` in your `$GOPATH/bin` folder. See the usage below.

## Usage

![ipfs-cluster-usage](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVMKD39fYJG9QGyyFkGN3QuZRg3EfuuxqkG1scCo9ZUHp/cluster-mgmt.gif)

### Quickstart

**`ipfs-cluster-service`** runs an ipfs-cluster peer:

* Initialize with `ipfs-cluster-service init`
    * You will be asked to enter a cluster secret. For more on this, see [the Cluster secret section of the `ipfs-cluster-service` * README](ipfs-cluster-service/dist/README.md#cluster-secret).
* Run with `ipfs-cluster-service`. Check `--help` for options

For more information see the [`ipfs-cluster-service` README](ipfs-cluster-service/dist/README.md). Also, read [A guide to running IPFS Cluster](docs/ipfs-cluster-guide.md) for full a full overview of how cluster works.

**`ipfs-cluster-ctl`** is used to interface with the ipfs-cluster peer:

```
ipfs-cluster-ctl id                    # see peer information
ipfs-cluster-ctl pin add <cid>         # Pin a CID in ipfs-cluster
ipfs-cluster-ctl pin rm <cid>          # Upin a CID
ipfs-cluster-ctl ls                    # See current pins and allocations
ipfs-cluster-ctl status <cid>          # See information from every allocation for a CID.
```

For information on how to manage and perform operations on an IPFS Cluster peer see the [`ipfs-cluster-ctl` README](ipfs-cluster-ctl/dist/README.md).

### Go

IPFS Cluster nodes can be launched directly from Go. The `Cluster` object provides methods to interact with the cluster and perform actions.

Documentation and examples on how to use IPFS Cluster from Go can be found in [godoc.org/github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster](https://godoc.org/github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster).

### Additional docs

You can find more information and detailed guides:

* [A guide to running IPFS Cluster](docs/ipfs-cluster-guide.md)
* [Building and updating an IPFS Cluster](docs/HOWTO_build_and_update_a_cluster.md)

Note: please contribute to improve and add more documentation!
