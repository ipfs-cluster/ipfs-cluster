# `ipfs-cluster-ctl`

> IPFS cluster management tool

`ipfs-cluster-ctl` is the client application to manage the cluster nodes and perform actions. `ipfs-cluster-ctl` uses the HTTP API provided by the nodes and it is completely separate from the cluster service.

### Usage

Usage information can be obtained by running:

```
$ ipfs-cluster-ctl --help
```

You can also obtain command-specific help with `ipfs-cluster-ctl help [cmd]`. The (`--host`) can be used to talk to any remote cluster peer (`localhost` is used by default).

For more information, please check the [Documentation](https://cluster.ipfs.io/documentation), in particular the [`ipfs-cluster-ctl` section](https://cluster.ipfs.io/documentation/ipfs-cluster-ctl).
